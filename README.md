dotvimdir
=========

Just a place to keep my vim configs.

There probably isn't much of interest to anyone else here, but heres how to install this anyway.

* Clone Recursive:
  
  `git clone --recursive git@github.com:danielpanzella/dotvimdir.git ~/.vim`

* Link .vimrc:

  `ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`

* Install Bundles

  `vim +PluginInstall +qall`
